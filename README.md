# VRGamepad
This program creates a virtual xbox360 controller from buttons pressed with VR controllers, it even runs alongside a VR game allowing you to play games that support xbox360 controller input from in VR with a few programs! Also I know the current support and lack of configuration is scuffed... sorry, i'll work on that when I have time

## How to setup to play local controller games with friends in VR:
1. Download and install [OVRDrop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/586210/OVRdrop/) ($15)
2. Download, install, sign up for [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/downloads) (install controller driver when prompted)
3. Download and extract my app
4. Launch Parsec and connect to partner
5. Launch SteamVR with any game
6. Launch OVRDrop, select Parsec Window
7. Launch my app, define right controller by holding grip and trackpad

### Bugs
Buttons mapped for Vive, the outputs I'm getting don't match any documentation so... i'm working on updating that
Trackpad dosn't send data to virtual controller if the controller was out of range oh the lighthouses when you start my program.

If you have any trouble with my program please let me know.
