# VRGamepad
This program creates a virtual xbox360 controller from buttons pressed with VR controllers, and is able to run while any other VR application is open.

## How to setup to play local controller games with friends in VR:
1. Download and install [OVRDrop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/586210/OVRdrop/) ($15)
2. Download, install, sign up for [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/downloads) (install controller driver when prompted)
3. Download and extract my app
4. Launch Parsec and connect to partner
5. Launch SteamVR with any game
6. Launch OVRDrop, select Parsec Window
7. Launch my app, define right controller by holding grip and trackpad

### Bugs
- Buttons are setup for Vive, Probly won't work for any other VR controllers at the moment
- Trackpad dosn't send data to virtual controller if the controller was out of range of the lighthouses when this program was opened.
- xbox "back" button opens annoying SteamVR popup (I don't recomend mapping it for now)
